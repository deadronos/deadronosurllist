# Active Context

- Focus: NextAuth session resilience; JWT/session callbacks now persist `session.user.id` without the Prisma adapter and have dedicated Vitest coverage.
- Focus: TASK010 now delivers a paginated public catalog with load-more UI, typed tRPC contract, and Vitest coverage for filtering/trimmed links.
- Focus: Vitest toolchain stabilized by retyping `vitest.config.ts` and gating the Playwright provider behind `VITEST_BROWSER`, keeping the primary scripts green.
- Next Actions: Monitor authentication flows for regressions, collect feedback on the new public catalog search and pagination UX, and plan for backend search offloading if datasets grow large.
- Dependencies: Prisma client runtime availability on Windows environments (build emits expected engine warnings).
