# Active Context

- Focus: Hardened database bootstrap, added custom NextAuth error screen, and guarded auth API to redirect when auth is disabled.
- Next Actions: Monitor preview rollout, confirm auth route guard prevents noisy errors, and re-enable full auth once real credentials are available.
- Dependencies: Prisma client types, NextAuth PrismaAdapter compatibility, ESLint configuration.
