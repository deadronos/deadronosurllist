# Active Context

- Focus: TASK017–TASK028 completed, covering security middleware, RLS-scoped DB access, error boundaries, Vercel deploy workflows, expanded Playwright coverage, performance monitoring, API docs, caching, advanced catalog search, and public user profiles.
- Focus: Public catalog now supports server-side search + sorting with cache invalidation and mock DB seed expansion for paging.
- Focus: Optional visual/load testing workflows are staged with manual triggers and environment gating.
- Next Actions: Monitor public profile UX, catalog search behavior, and RLS policy impact in production; schedule visual/load runs when a stable base URL is available.
- Dependencies: Prisma client runtime availability on Windows environments (build emits expected engine warnings).
