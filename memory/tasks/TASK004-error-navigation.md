# TASK004 - Error Navigation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09

## Original Request

> maybe the error pages should have that also

## Thought Process

- Error and 404 pages currently lack explicit navigation actions beyond the global header.
- Providing a dedicated home button within these pages reduces user confusion during failure states.
- Next.js App Router supports custom `error.tsx` (client) and `not-found.tsx` (server) components, ideal for this enhancement.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Design Alignment**
   - Use Radix UI components to mirror the aesthetic of the home page while keeping messaging concise.
2. **Error Page (`error.tsx`)**
   - Implement the client component with reset handling and a home button.
3. **Not Found Page (`not-found.tsx`)**
   - Provide a friendly 404 message and home button.
4. **Verification**
   - Manually verify both pages render and buttons navigate correctly.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
