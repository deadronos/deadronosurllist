# TASK012 - Typecheck stabilization

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-11  
**Updated:** 2025-10-11

## Original Request

> fix typechecks, run linters and formatter

## Thought Process

TypeScript strictness caught three classes of issues:

1. Auth callback tests deliberately exercise scenarios where NextAuth omits the `user` payload, but the type definitions mark that field as required.
2. Link router authorization tests dereference `links` without guaranteeing the collection fetch succeeded, triggering strict-null complaints.
3. The global test setup stubs `process` too loosely, and the Vitest configuration registers the Playwright provider as if it were a Vite plugin, violating type contracts.

Resolving these ensures we keep valuable coverage while satisfying the compiler.

Confidence Score: 90 (High). Runtime behaviour is already covered; fixes are limited to test harness and config hygiene.

## Implementation Plan

1. Align the auth callback tests with NextAuth typings by introducing local type aliases and explicit casts with documentation where runtime omits `user`.
2. Refine the link router tests to coerce collection fetches via `ensureCollectionResult` (or throw) before using `links`, eliminating optional chaining warnings.
3. Harden `src/test/setup.ts` so the `process` shim always provides `NODE_ENV` and matches the `NodeJS.Process` type surface.
4. Update `vitest.config.ts` to remove the invalid Playwright plugin registration while keeping the provider wired through the `browser` block.
5. Run `npm run format:write`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` to verify formatting, linting, and type safety.

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-11

- Task created and scoped; design reference: `memory/designs/DESIGN010-typecheck-stabilization.md`.
- Updated auth/session callback tests, link router helpers, test setup shim, and Vitest config to satisfy strict TypeScript.
- Ran `npm run format:write`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` to confirm formatting, linting, and compilation all succeed.
