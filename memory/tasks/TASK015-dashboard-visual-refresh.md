# TASK015 – Dashboard Visual Refresh & Catalog Link Limit

## Overview

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Codex (AI)
- **Related Design:** `memory/designs/DESIGN013-dashboard-visual-refresh.md`
- **Requirements:** `requirements.md` → Public Collections Catalog & Dashboard Visual Consistency

## Goals

1. Raise the public catalog trimmed link limit from 3 to 10 for coherent load-more behavior.
2. Bring the `/dashboard` route and collection creation workflow into parity with the Radix-themed landing page.

## Implementation Plan

| Step | Description | Expected Outcome | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Update constants and docs so `getPublicCatalog` trims to 10 links; extend router spec coverage. | API delivers up to ten links by default; tests cover trimming. | None |
| 2 | Restyle `dashboard/page.tsx` unauthenticated and authenticated views using Radix containers/cards with gradient background. | Dashboard visually matches landing page while retaining guard behavior. | Step 1 |
| 3 | Refactor `CollectionCreateForm` inputs/buttons to Radix components and ensure mutation logic still resets/invalidate. | Form looks consistent and remains functional. | Step 2 |
| 4 | Run lint + focused tests; perform manual dashboard check; document updates in memory. | Validation confirms no regressions; documentation reflects changes. | Steps 1-3 |

## Validation Checklist

- [x] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run test -- --run collectionRouter.spec.ts`
- [ ] Manual dashboard smoke test (theme, form submission, card navigation)

## Validation Log

- 2025-10-12: `npm run lint` — pass.
- 2025-10-12: `npm run test -- --run collectionRouter.spec.ts` — fails locally (missing optional Rollup native binary on Windows; existing npm issue #4828).

## Notes & Risks

- Radix components introduce new markup; verify client hydration warnings do not appear.
- Mutation flow currently lacks user-facing error state; consider future toast/snackbar enhancement.
