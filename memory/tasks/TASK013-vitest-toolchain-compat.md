# TASK013 - Vitest toolchain compatibility

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-11  
**Updated:** 2025-10-11

## Original Request

Fix the failing `npm run test`/`npm run typecheck` caused by tooling drift, run `npm run lint --fix`, and normalize formatting with Prettier.

## Thought Process

- `npm run typecheck` fails with TS2305 in `vitest.config.ts` because `UserConfig` is no longer exported from `vitest/config` after the Vitest 4 beta upgrade.
- The vitest configuration presently depends on the type alias to keep the optional browser provider strongly typed; we should re-source the type from `vite`, which Vitest augments at compile time.
- Once the configuration compiles, the downstream scripts (`lint:fix`, `test`, `format:write`) should succeed without additional code changes.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Repoint Vitest configuration types** – Import `UserConfig` from `vite` and retain the `BrowserConfig` alias so the optional browser provider remains type-safe. _(Depends on DESIGN011)_
2. **Validate tooling commands** – Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint:fix`, `npm run test`, and `npm run format:write` to confirm the toolchain is green. _(Depends on step 1)_
3. **Update Memory Bank** – Record outcomes in `progress.md`, adjust `activeContext.md`, and close the task once commands pass. _(Depends on step 2)_

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed – 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-11

- Captured requirements in `memory/requirements.md` and authored DESIGN011 describing the configuration fix, error handling matrix, and validation plan.
- Created TASK013 implementation plan outlining configuration refactor and verification commands.
- Repointed `vitest.config.ts` to use Vite typings, gated Playwright provider behind `VITEST_BROWSER`, and confirmed typecheck/lint/test/format scripts all succeed.
