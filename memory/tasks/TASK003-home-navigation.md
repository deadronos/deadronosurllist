# TASK003 - Persistent Home Navigation

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09

## Original Request

> maybe the every other page should have a button linked to get back to the root URL

## Thought Process

- Currently, only specific pages expose navigation; adding a consistent “Home” control improves wayfinding.
- The Next.js root layout wraps all routes, so placing the button there ensures global coverage without duplicating code.
- The control should match the Radix-themed aesthetic and avoid obscuring page content.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Header Layout**
   - Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to wrap children with a flex column and prepend a header containing the home button.
2. **Home Button Styling**
   - Use Radix UI components (e.g., `Button` or `Link`) with translucent styling to keep it lightweight.
3. **Spacing Adjustments**
   - Ensure the main content accounts for header height (padding/margin) so layouts remain balanced.
4. **Verification**
   - Manually confirm the button appears on non-root routes (e.g., `/signin`) and navigates back to `/`.

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
