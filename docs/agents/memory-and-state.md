# Memory Bank & State Tracking

This project uses a structured Memory Bank for context preservation.

## Memory Location

The `/memory/` folder is the source of truth for the project's current state.

## Core Files

- `activeContext.md`: Current focus and recent changes.
- `progress.md`: What has been built and what is left.
- `projectbrief.md`: High-level goals and requirements.
- `tasks/_index.md`: Master list of tasks.

## Rules

1. **Check First**: Review memory files before starting any work.
2. **Update Often**: Document significant changes and progress in the memory system.
3. **ID Management**: Ensure unique Task/Design IDs across active folders and `/COMPLETED/` subfolders.
4. **Context**: Update `activeContext.md` with your current focus before and after sessions.
